# Graph-Project-
This project was done during my third year at Insa Toulouse.
The main purpose of this project was to develop  shortest path algorithms(time and distance shortest path ).
We implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.
We did some performance tests to proove that the algortihms were well implemented(read performance_test.pdf ).
